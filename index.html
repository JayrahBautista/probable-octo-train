  <h2>Calle Crisologo, Vigan</h2>
  <p>
    The town has successfully managed to preserve the historic district where you can still find calesas (horse-drawn carriages). Sample the famous and delicious Ilocos empanada, and walk along cobbled streets lined up with souvenir shops selling pottery and Abel Iloko weaves, among the many things to see and do when in Vigan.
